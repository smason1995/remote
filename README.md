### Desc:
    Remote is a CLI-based manager for SSH and SFTP connections via terminals while being terminal agnostic.

### TODO (needs to be prioritized):
    - Allow adding and removal of multiple profiles at once
    - Make profiles easily editable via remote
    - Encrypt profile list for added security
    - Allow remote to run ssh urls directly
    - Make distro packages (aiming to support Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Opensuse)
    - Write MAN page
    - Add support for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
    - Attempt to get support for Mac (if the reousrces to test it become available)
